I went back and forth on a bunch of different solutions to publish a log of my progress in my **Year of Game Dev**. Unfortunately, I'm quite limited in my options when it comes to sharing my work with my work friends at work because of the simple fact that the work won't let you just access any old website. Probably a smart move on their part, but a thorn in my side for getting this particular project off the ground.

I wanted to stick with a basic markdown workflow, because I really like markdown. I like how portable it is. I like how easy it is to write unassisted (though I still use assistance like a fancy editor). I also wanted to stick with free because I'm not trying to pay for seven people to read my thoughts.

I thought I'd use GitHub Pages, the free static site hosting solution offered by GitHub. Unfortunately, I've hooked that up to my personal domain, and I guess that extends to every project level site I'd like to set up as well. Good for branding, bad for my particular use case.

***I don't want to.***

So that's how I landed here. A simple repo with markdown files that I edit with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), my favorite second brain. You can see when I post a given blog by when I push to the repo, and GitHub has a pretty nice markdown reader to read this stuff.

Unfortunately, GitHub won't sort these files except alphabetically. I've got a solve for that with my handy dandy unique note creator. That'll prepend each title with a to-the-minute timestamp of creation, which should effectively sort these posts chronologically.

All this effort just to make a blog... if only I spent this much time making games!
