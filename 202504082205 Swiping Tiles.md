# Swiping Tiles

This month, I'm making a game I'm calling TileSwiper. Well, it's actually more like a bundle of games because I can't quite decide what the mechanics should be. You see, unlike February's project, [Super Bario Clone](https://bustedspecs.itch.io/super-bario), TileSwiper is an "original" idea I thought up over a decade ago during my time in California over a decade ago. I'd tried to make it several times, but ran out of steam one way or another each time.

April's going to be a short month for this project because of work obligations and certain personal uncertainties, so I decided to do a more casual style game that you could easily pick up and put down in a few minutes. I did a few casual game dev tutorials like Flappy Bird and an unnamed game where you avoid and shoot falling tiles, and was able to do both of those each in a sitting. That gave me some confidence that even though this is an original concept, the game itself is pretty simple.

My first sitting developing this thing ended up like this:

Essentially, you have a square tile in the middle of a square screen with text telling you where to swipe it off of the screen. Swipe it any other direction, you get a time penalty. Swipe it correctly, it zips off the screen in that direction, you get a point, and another tile fades into view.

I started with the core game mechanic: swiping tiles off the screen. First, need to make a tile to swipe off the screen. Fairly straightforward. I started with a 100px square color rect, centered a label on it, and gave it some code to handle randomizing direction, and handle getting swiped in a given direction. The actual input code is held at the game level. The AnimationPlayer holds an automatic animation that fades in the tile on load.

The actual game level code wasn't too bad either. The scene just has the starting tile, the UI labels, and an auto timer that ticks every second. The code handles input, updates the ui every tick of the timer, as well as actual game logic such as scoring, time running out, etc.

Those are the interesting bits. I also put in a main menu and game over scene to fully round out the experience. What a huge contrast from my last project, which really didn't have a complete uninterrupted gameplay session until nearly the end of the month!

## Key Takeaways

### Swiping is hard, keys are easy

Then I realized my first problem that probably killed a ton of my iterations: swipe detection is hard to nail down, especially with a mouse. One of the many lessons I've learnt through my endeavors, though, is when swipes get you down, just use arrow keys. That was easy enough to implement, especially since I'd just gotten done making a platformer.

I'd like to figure this out for a mobile deployment of the game, as that was my original vision. However, this game is functionally complete in a few hours because I was willing to compromise on that vision. Don't let perfect be the enemy of done.

### UI Nodes

UI Nodes are great for easily anchoring nodes to portions of the screen. I learned this lesson from the hyper casual game I mentioned earlier, and it really came in handy here. I know some of my previous iterations involved me trying to do a bunch of math to figure out where the top-left corner of the screen was at any resolution. UI Nodes, Anchors, and the viewport Stretch mode in the project settings make this a piece of cake. I can change the size of the window and the score and time labels will all stick exactly where they were when the game started.

### Scaling

Speaking of viewport stretching, I also discovered that using the window width overrides or stretching the window to make it bigger does make the default godot font blurry. I'm sure scaling down from a large viewport might have the opposite effect, but I'm pretty satisfied with the current size.
